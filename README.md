## Features

- High-quality and consistent user interface for digitizing physical documents.
- Accurate document detection with precise corner and edge detection for optimal scanning results.
- Flexible functionality allows users to crop scanned documents, apply filters, remove fingers, remove stains and other blemishes.
- On-device processing helps preserve privacy.
- Support for sending digitized files in PDF and JPEG formats back to your app.
- Ability to set a scan page limit.
- Support for image(png,jpeg) format and PDF has been added through various methods.


## Installation

To use this plugin, add `flutter_doc_scanner` as a dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_doc_scanner: ^0.0.15

```
Got it! Here's a more detailed explanation:

## Usage

Use the following function for document scanning on Android and iOS:

```dart
  Future<void> scanDocument() async {
  //by default way they fetch pdf for android and png for iOS
  dynamic scannedDocuments;
  try {
    scannedDocuments = await FlutterDocScanner().getScanDocuments(page: 3) ??
        'Unknown platform documents';
  } on PlatformException {
    scannedDocuments = 'Failed to get scanned documents.';
  }
  print(scannedDocuments.toString());
}
```
**Note-: If you want to obtain only a PDF scanned document, call getScannedDocumentAsPdf(). Similarly, if you want to get a scanned document in image format, use getScannedDocumentAsImages().**


## Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up your Flutter project on Android, iOS, and Web.

### Android

#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on Android devices.
In the `android/app/build.gradle` file, verify that `minSdkVersion` is at least 21. This setting specifies the minimum Android API level required to run your app, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of Android devices.

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### iOS
#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on iOS devices.
In the `ios/Podfile` file, make sure the iOS platform version is at least 13.0. This setting specifies the minimum iOS version required to run your app, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of iOS devices.

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```

#### Permission Configuration
1. Add a String property to the app's Info.plist file with the key `NSCameraUsageDescription` and the value as the description for why your app needs camera access. This step is required by Apple to explain to users why the app needs access to the camera, and it's crucial for App Store approval.

```ruby
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Camera Permission Description</string>
```

2. The `permission_handler` dependency used by `flutter_doc_scanner` uses macros to control whether a permission is enabled. To enable camera permission, add the following to your `Podfile` file. This step ensures that your app can request and handle camera permissions on iOS devices:

 ```ruby
   post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       ... # Here are some configurations automatically generated by flutter

       # Start of the permission_handler configuration
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|

         # You can enable the permissions needed here. For example, to enable camera
         # permission, just remove the `#` character in front so it looks like this:
         #
         # ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
         # 'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1'
         #
         #  Preprocessor definitions can be found at: https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h
         config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
           '$(inherited)',

           ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
           'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',
         ]

       end
       # End of the permission_handler configuration
     end
   end
   ```

### Web
Currently, we have removed web support for this library. For document scanning on the web, you can use the following library: [flutter_doc_scanner_web](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_doc_scanner_web).
